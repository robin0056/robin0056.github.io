            <p>In the heart of Ryd, where stories unfold,<br>
                An old motel stands with secrets untold.<br>
                Its weathered walls echo love's sweet embrace,<br>
                Whispering tales of passion and grace.<br>
                <br>
                Within its rooms, love's symphony played,<br>
                In whispered words and promises made.<br>
                Old tools rest there, witnesses in time,<br>
                Crafting memories, stories so sublime.<br>
                <br>
                Beside the motel, an old car remains,<br>
                A relic of love's enduring refrains.<br>
                Two souls intertwined, on roads they'd explore,<br>
                A journey of love, forever to endure.<br>
                <br>
                An aged church stands, weathered by years,<br>
                Its beauty may fade, but memory clears.<br>
                Where vows were exchanged, love's flame ignited,<br>
                Its spirit lives on, though time's course has slighted.<br>
                <br>
                Beneath the skies of Ryd, where dreams still soar,<br>
                Old apple trees stand, memories to adore.<br>
                Their branches outstretch, like love's embrace,<br>
                Witnesses to a love that time cannot erase.</p>
